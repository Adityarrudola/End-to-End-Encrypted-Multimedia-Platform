# 🔐 Secure Chat App – Python Based End-to-End Encrypted Multimedia Platform

A **real-time chat application** built with **Streamlit**, featuring **end-to-end encryption** using the `cryptography` library. This project demonstrates secure message exchange, lightweight UI, and interactive experience—all in your browser.

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) – For building the web UI  
- **Python 3**  
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – For data handling  
- [Cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) – For message encryption and decryption  

---

## 📂 Features

- ✅ **Real-time chat simulation** using Streamlit widgets  
- ✅ **AES encryption** of all messages before sending  
- ✅ **Secure message decryption** using symmetric keys  
- ✅ Clean, responsive UI for sender and receiver  
- ✅ Easy-to-use interface – no login required  
- ✅ Works entirely in-browser with no backend needed  

---

## 🔐 How Encryption Works

- The app uses **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** with **Fernet symmetric encryption**.  
- Each message is encrypted with a key before being sent.  
- On the receiver side, the message is decrypted using the same key.  
- Prevents eavesdropping or tampering.
